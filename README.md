## Idea behind gm-grid.

I have used a lot of grid system I have used.
Many are responsive, many are mobile first.
But most of them seriously, don't solve the real issue.
As a designer we think in terms of percentages rather than grid.

We don't know about everyone.
But we think that 12-grid and 16-grid will not be a better grid system.
It's not futuristic.

You can't be increasing the Grids based on the size of the screen size.
We don't entire think percentage will solve the problem.
We are constantly exploring the system.

We found [Kube CSS-Framework](imperavi.com/kube/grid/).
Which is where we are inspired from.

> Grid make your website, the website.

Designers using bootstrap and other frameworks are seriously using grid not the other components.
